    "# NBA Four Factors Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking Justin Jacobs's idea in the [Squared 2020 Blog](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/05/introduction-to-olivers-four-factors/), this notebook deals with obtaining Four Factors data for the last 2020 regular seasons and see how important each of them were over the years. First, a little introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Four Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "The term is based on what Dean Oliver called the *Four Factors of Basketball Success*, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shooting\n",
    "- Turnovers\n",
    "- Rebounding\n",
    "- Free Throws\n",
    "\n",
    "These are important for any team both on offense and defense, and for that reason we can think that we have 8 factors instead of 4 and they can be obtained from just the box scores. I will explain them a bit more in detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shooting\n",
    "As we all now, the team that gets more points wins basketball games. This factor is measured as the *Effective Field Goal Percentage* (EFG%):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "EFG\\% = \\frac{FGM + 0.5 FG3M}{FGA},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- FGM: Field Goals Made\n",
    "- FG3M: 3-Point Shots Made\n",
    "- FGA: Field Goal Attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turnovers\n",
    "Teams need to take care of the ball to get the best out of their possessions. This factor is measured with the *Turnover Percentage* (TOV%):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "TOV\\% = \\frac{TOV}{POSS},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- TOV: Turnovers\n",
    "- POSS: Amount of Possessions in the Season\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rebounding\n",
    "An offensive rebound is another way of making the best of our possessions in case we don't shoot the ball well, taking second (or more) chances to score. The offensive rebounding factor is the *Offensive Rebound Percentage* (ORB%):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ORB\\% = \\frac{ORB}{ORB + OppDRB},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- ORB: Offensive Rebounds\n",
    "- OppDRB. Opponents's Defensive Rebounds\n",
    "\n",
    "For the defensive rebounding factor, we can get the ORB% for the opponents (OppORB%, this is the one available in the NBA Stats Page) or the *Defensive Rebounding Percentage* (DRB%):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "DRB\\% = \\frac{DRB}{DRB + OppORB},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- DRB: Defensive Rebounds\n",
    "- OppORB. Opponents's Offensive Rebounds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free Throws\n",
    "Lastly, one of the ways we can end a possession is by getting to the free throw line (except when getting shots because of technical or flagrant fouls). This is the relationship between the amount of free throws a team attempted (FTA) and the field goals attempted (FGA), the *Free Throw Rate* (FTRATE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "FTRATE = \\frac{FTA}{FGA}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing NBA Four Factors Importance\n",
    "Luckily, the NBA Stats Page has these factors already computed for a lot of seaons for us to use, so we will use it to get the Four Factors for the last 20 seasons and get the importance of each of them over the years, by adjusting a linear model and try to predict the winning percentage of the teams. In this case, winning percentage might be better than amount of wins, since we had a couple of seasons with a weird number of games played (thanks to some virus).\n",
